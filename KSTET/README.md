# KSTET exploits for VulnServer

KSTET is a very interesting command in VulnServer as it forces us to cope with very little buffer space.

I have solved KSTET in two different ways:

1. kstet-egghunter: I use the 66 bytes available to deploy an egghunter and a different VulnServer command to inject the payload.
2. ws2_32-recv-reuse: I use custom shellcode to call the `recv` function and receive the shellcode from my machine.
