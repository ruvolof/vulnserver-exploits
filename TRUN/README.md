# TRUN exploit for Vulnserver

TRUN command is vulnerable to a stack based buffer overflow.

The following scripts have been used to develop the full exploit:

1. trun_0poc.pl: just crash the service.
2. trun_1offsets.pl: sends a unique string to calculate offsets.
3. trun_2eip.pl: overrides EIP with a pointer to a `jmp esp`.
4. trun_3badchars.pl: sends all possible characters to find badchars.
5. trun_4exploit.pl: complete exploit with payload.
