# GMON exploit for Vulnserver

GMON command is vulnerable to a seh based buffer overflow.

The following scripts have been used to develop the full exploit:

1. gmon_0poc.pl: just crash the service.
2. gmon_1offsets.pl: sends a unique string to calculate offsets.
3. gmon_2seh.pl: overrides SEH with a pointer to a `pop pop ret`.
4. gmon_3jumps.pl: first stage shellcode to reach our buffer.
5. gmon_4exploit.pl: complete exploit with payload.
